Multiplayer game of word construction.

Rules
=====

* AJWords is a game in word construction on a bounded rectangular game field (for two players the game field 5 by 5 cells is usually used).
* At the game beginning a random initial word is inserted in the middle of the game field. After that, the players make their moves by turns.
* To make a move the player must put a letter into any game field cell (at least one of the nearest cells must also include a letter) and construct a new word which can be read by moving through adjacent cells as a chess king. The word must be a common singular noun; a plural noun is allowable if it is not used or rarely used in the singular form. The letter chain must be inseparable and non-crossing.
* The player gets points for the constructed word, the number of points equals to the word length. It is not allowed to move through one cell twice and repeat already formed words.
* The game is over when the entire game field is filled or when players cannot construct words for two turns in a row.
* The player with the maximum score wins.
